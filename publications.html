		<div class="articleTitle">Teaching introductory programming through reusable learning objects: a pilot study</div>
		<div class="articleAuthors">Giovanni Vincenti, James Braman, and J. Scott Hilberg</div>
		<div class="articlePublication">Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 28.3(2013): 38-45</div>
		<div class="articleAbstract">This paper describes a pilot study that examines the perceived effectiveness and usability of a dynamic reusable learning object that enriches lecture material in an introductory programming course. In particular, we focus on the topic of looping by providing students an interactive tool that lets them simulate and review the execution of code. The results suggest that students in CS0 courses may utilize this tool for learning about looping, while CS1 students are more likely to use it for reviewing concepts that they learned in class. The findings of this pilot study have enabled us to focus on which aspects to improve for the next set of reusable learning objects.</div>

		<div class="articleTitle">Imprecise temporal associations and decision support systems</div>
		<div class="articleAuthors">Giovanni Vincenti</div>
		<div class="articlePublication">Procedia computer science, 130(2018): 961-966</div>
		<div class="articleAbstract">The quick and pervasive infiltration of decision support systems, artificial intelligence, and data mining in consumer electronics and everyday life in general has been significant in recent years. Fields such as UX have been facilitating the integration of such technologies into software and hardware, but the back-end processing is still based on binary foundations. This article describes an approach to mining for imprecise temporal associations among events in data streams, taking into account the very natural concept of approximation. This type of association analysis is likely to lead to more meaningful and actionable decision support systems.</div>
