Track the usage of the mouse.

Also track the speed of typing. Different situations, like coming up with a story, trying to copy some text, and answering questions to which you know the answer, and questions to something you just learned? Maybe turn it into a web browser extension?

Something that they recall
- Ask the user to write about some event in their life

Something that they just learned
- Show the reader a paragraph or two, then ask them to summarize

Something that they invented
- Give the user a writing prompt and then ask them to write a paragraph

Something they are copying
